## About

In the "About" section, I provide a brief introduction about myself and my journey as a developer. I'm constantly striving to improve my skills and explore new technologies. Currently, I'm actively learning JavaScript and training in NODE.js. I believe that APIs are the way forward and am excited about the possibilities they offer.

## Work

The "Work" section showcases some of the applications I've developed. Each application is accompanied by a titled image that gives you a glimpse of what it looks like. Clicking on the images will take you to the deployed applications where you can interact with them.

Please note that the portfolio is a work in progress, and I'll be adding more applications as I continue my journey in the world of development.
